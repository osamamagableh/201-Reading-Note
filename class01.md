**# Structure
In order to teach you about creating web pages, 
this book is divided into three sections:
1. html 
2. css
3. Practical

* in html We will spend the first chapter looking at how HTML is used to 
create web pages. You will see that you start by writing down the words
you want to appear on your page. You then add tags or elements to the
words so that the browser knows what is a heading, where a paragraph 
begins and ends, and so on.The rest of this section introduces the
tags you have at your disposal to create web pages, grouped into chapters on: 
text, lists, links, images, tables, forms, video audio and flash, and 
miscellaneous elements.I should warn you that the examples in the first nine 
chapters are not exciting to look at, yet they are the foundation of 
every web page. The following chapters on CSS will show you how to make
 your pages look a lot more interesting. *

 * in css Presentation: How to control things like the color of text, the 
fonts you want to use and the size of those fonts, how to add background 
colors to pages (or parts of a page), and how to add background images.
Layout: How to control where the different elements are positioned on the screen.
You will also learn several techniques that professionals use to make 
their pages more attractive. *

* in practical We end up with some helpful information that will assist you in 
building better websites. We look at some new tags that will be introduced in
HTML5 to help describe the structure of your pages. HTML5 is the latest 
version of HTML (still under development at the time of writing). Before 
learning about these elements, you need a good grasp of how CSS is used to 
control the design of web pages. There is a chapter that talks you through
a design process that you might like to follow when creating a new websit *

** How Pages Use Structure **
Think about the stories you read in a newspaper: for each 
story, there will be a headline, some text, and possibly some 
images. If the article is a long piece, there may be subheadings 
that split the story into separate sections or quotes from those 
involved. Structure helps readers understand the stories in the 
newspaper.

** Structuring Word Documents **
The use of headings and subheadings in any document 
often reflects a hierarchy of information. For example, a 
document might start with a large heading, followed by 
an introduction or the most important information.
This might be expanded upon under subheadings lower down 
on the page. When using a word processor to create a document, 
we separate out the text to give it structure. Each topic might 
have a new paragraph, and each section can have a heading to 
describe what it covers.

** what is javascript ** 
* JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user. Common examples of JavaScript that you might use every day include the search box on Amazon, a news recap video embedded on The New York Times, or refreshing your Twitter feed.  

Incorporating JavaScript improves the user experience of the web page by converting it from a static page into an interactive one. To recap, JavaScript adds behavior to web pages. *
