You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box. 
Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.

You might think that your site is likely to have images of all different sizes, but a lot of sites use the same sized image across 
many of their pages. For example, an e-commerce site tends to show product photos at the same size. Or, if your site is designed on a grid, then you might have a selection of image sizes that are commonly used on all pages, such as:Small portrait: 220 x 360 Small landscape: 330 x 210 Feature photo: 620 x 400 Whenever you use consistently 
sized images across a site, you can use CSS to control the dimensions of the images, instead of putting the dimensions in the HTML.

The background-size CSS property lets you resize the background image of an element, overriding the default behavior of tiling the image at its full size by specifying the width and/or height of the image. By doing so, you can scale the image upward or downward as desired.

<div class="tiledBackground">
</div>
CSS
.tiledBackground {
  background-image: url(https://www.mozilla.org/media/img/logos/firefox/logo-quantum.9c5e96634f92.png);
  background-size: 150px;
  width: 300px;
  height: 300px;
  border: 2px solid;
  color: pink;
}

- You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.

using CSS.
- You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page. 
- Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.
- You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.
- To reduce the number of images your browser has to  load, you can create image sprites

Search engine optimization helps visitors find your 
sites when using search engines.
Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to 
see how many people visit your site, how they find it, 
and what they do when they get there.
To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a 
domain name and web hosting.
FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your 
local computer to your web server.
