# Transform 

With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.

The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

Within this lesson we’ll take a look at both two-dimensional and three-dimensional transforms. Generally speaking, browser support for the transform property isn’t great, but it is getting better every day. For the best support vendor prefixes are encouraged, however you may need to download the nightly version of Chrome to see all of these transforms in action.

**Transform Syntax**
The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

div {
  -webkit-transform: scale(1.5);
     -moz-transform: scale(1.5);
       -o-transform: scale(1.5);
          transform: scale(1.5);
}


**2D Transforms**
Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. We’ll start by discussing how to transform elements on a two-dimensional plane, and then work our way into three-dimensional transforms.

HTML
<figure class="box-1">Box 1</figure>
<figure class="box-2">Box 2</figure>
              
CSS
box-1 {
  transform: rotate(20deg);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: rotate(-55deg);
}

# transition and animation

One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations. Front end developers have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript or Flash, for years. Now their wish has come true.

With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.


**Transition Duration**
The duration in which a transition takes place is set using the transition-duration property. The value of this property can be set using general timing values, including seconds (s) and milliseconds (ms). These timing values may also come in fractional measurements, .2s for example.

When transitioning multiple properties you can set multiple durations, one for each property. As with the transition-property property value, multiple durations can be declared using comma separated values. The order of these values when identifying individual properties and durations does matter. For example, the first property identified within the transition-property property will match up with the first time identified within the transition-duration property, and so forth.

If multiple properties are being transitioned with only one duration value declared, that one value will be the duration of all the transitioned properties.

box {
  background: #2db34a;
  border-radius: 6px;
  transition-property: background, border-radius;
  transition-duration: .2s, 1s;
  transition-timing-function: linear;
}
.box:hover {
  background: #ff7b29;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
CSS3 has introduced countless possibilities for UX designers, and the best thing about them is that the coolest parts are really simple to implement.

Just a couple of lines of code will give you an awesome transition effect that will excite your users, increase engagement and ultimately, when used well, increase your conversions. What’s more, these effects are hardware accelerated, and a progressive enhancement that you can use right now.

Here are 8 really simple effects that will add life to your UI and smiles to your users’ faces.

All of these effects (bar one) are controlled with the transition property. So we can see these effects working, we’ll set up a div in an HTML page:

<html>
<head>
    <style type="text/css">
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div></div>
</body>
</html>
Having done so, set its width and height (so it has dimensions), its background color (so we can see it) and its transition property.

<style type="text/css">
body > div
{
            width:483px;
            height:298px;
            background:#676470;
            transition:all 0.3s ease;
}
</style>

**Rotate elements**
CSS transforms have a number of different uses, and one of the best is transforming the rotation of an element. Give your div the class “rotate” and add the following to your CSS:

.rotate:hover
{
        -webkit-transform: rotateZ(-30deg);
        -ms-transform: rotateZ(-30deg);
        transform: rotateZ(-30deg);
}

**Square to circle**
A really popular effect at the moment is transitioning a square element into a round one, and vice versa. With CSS, it’s a simple effect to achieve, we just transition the border-radius property.

Give your div the class “circle” and add this CSS to your styles:

.circle:hover
{
        border-radius:50%;
}
