** HTML Layouts **
HTML layouts provide a way to arrange web pages in well-mannered, well-structured, and in responsive form or we can say that HTML layout specifies a way in which the web pages can be arranged. Web-page layout works with arrangement of visual elements of an HTML document.

Web page layout is the most important part to keep in mind while creating a website so that our website can appear professional with the great look. You can also use CSS and JAVASCRIPT based frameworks for creating layouts for responsive and dynamic website designing.

Following are different HTML5 elements which are used to define the different parts of a webpage.

- <header>: It is used to define a header for a document or a section.
- <nav>: It is used to define a container for navigation links
- <section>: It is used to define a section in a document
- <article>: It is used to define an independent self-contained article
- <aside>: It is used to define content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
- <footer>: It is used to define a footer for a document or a section
- <details>: It is used to define additional details
- <summary>: It is used to define a heading for the <details> element

NOTE: HTML layouts create an individual space for every part of the web page. So that every element can arrange in a significant order.

** HTML <header> **
The <header> element is used to create header section of web pages. The header contains the introductory content, heading element, logo or icon for the webpage, and authorship information.

Example:
<header style="background-color: #303030;  height: 80px; width: 100%">  
      <h1 style="font-size: 30px; color: white;text-align: center; padding-top: 15px;">Welcome to     MyFirstWebpage</h1>  
   </header>

<div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).Grids help create professional and flexible designs.CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.You can include multiple CSS files in one page

CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they are positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window.  The page layout techniques we'll be covering in more detail in this module are

1. Normal flow
2. The display property
3. Flexbox
4. Grid
5. Floats
6. Positioning
7. Table layout
8. Multiple-column layout
 Each technique has its uses, advantages, and disadvantages, and no technique is designed to be used in isolation. By understanding what each method is designed for you will be in a good place to understand which is the best layout tool for each task.
